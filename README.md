# ONTlock

Decentralized password manager built on Ontology

### How it works

- Everyone can store up to 5 passwords
- `stake` 50 LOCK for 45000 blocks to gain 5 more slots
- `burn` 500 LOCK to gain 5 more slots

Scenario 1:

- With 1000 LOCK
- `stake` 1000 LOCK, get 100 slots
- Total is 105 = 100 + 5

Scenario 2:

- With 1000 LOCK
- `burn` 1000 LOCK, get 10 slots
- Total is 15 = 10 + 5

Scenario 3:

- With 1000 LOCK
- `stake` 500 LOCK, get 50 slots
- `burn` 500 LOCK, get 5 slots
- Total is 60 = 50 + 5 + 5
